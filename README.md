# PF-Project
This project has simple scenerios as you have some awareness with the chess game.
This game starts by showing the grid on which you have seen the names of the different chess pieces and first the game ask you for entering the row and column of the piece you want to move on the board. 
After entering the location it will show you the locations of the piece where it can only have access to move according to the game rules.
It takes input from the user for enter the location on which coordinates you want to move that piece, as you can easily see the loactions of its movement by seeing "0" at its movement places.
You piece will move to that place.
Now, good thing here is that we are playing with AI and as you move your piece AI immediately move the random piece of its own choice, but the logic is built so nicely that it have only access to its own pieces.
Now, as our goal is to trap the king, this game doesn't ends till the king got trapped.
Enjoy it by running it and by playing it.
